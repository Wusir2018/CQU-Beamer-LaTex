%Radio propagation is the behavior of radio waves when they are
%transmitted, or propagated from one point on the Earth to another,
%or into various parts of the atmosphere.[1] As a form of
%electromagnetic radiation, like light waves, radio waves are
%affected by the phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction,
%absorption, polarization and scattering.[2]

%Radio propagation is affected by the daily changes of water vapor in
%the troposphere and ionization in the upper atmosphere, due to the
%Sun. Understanding the effects of varying conditions on radio
%propagation has many practical applications, from choosing
%frequencies for international shortwave broadcasters, to designing
%reliable mobile telephone systems, to radio navigation, to operation
%of radar systems.
%
%Radio propagation is also affected by several other factors
%determined by its path from point to point. This path can be a
%direct line of sight path or an over-the-horizon path aided by
%refraction in the ionosphere, which is a region between
%approximately 60 and 600 km.[3] Factors influencing ionospheric
%radio signal propagation can include sporadic-E, spread-F, solar
%flares, geomagnetic storms, ionospheric layer tilts, and solar
%proton events.
%
%Radio waves at different frequencies propagate in different ways. At
%extra low frequencies (ELF) and very low frequencies the wavelength
%is very much larger than the separation between the earth's surface
%and the D layer of the ionosphere, so electromagnetic waves may
%propagate in this region as a waveguide. Indeed, for frequencies
%below 20 kHz, the wave propagates as a single waveguide mode with a
%horizontal magnetic field and vertical electric field.[4] The
%interaction of radio waves with the ionized regions of the
%atmosphere makes radio propagation more complex to predict and
%analyze than in free space. Ionospheric radio propagation has a
%strong connection to space weather. A sudden ionospheric disturbance
%or shortwave fadeout is observed when the x-rays associated with a
%solar flare ionize the ionospheric D-region.[citation needed]
%Enhanced ionization in that region increases the absorption of radio
%signals passing through it. During the strongest solar x-ray flares,
%complete absorption of virtually all ionospherically propagated
%radio signals in the sunlit hemisphere can occur.[citation needed]
%These solar flares can disrupt HF radio propagation and affect GPS
%accuracy.
